# Shutting down refugee immigrations means more suicidal bombings

## IS vicious plan

The act of terrorism is backed by a meticulous and insidious calculation. Suicidal bombing has stepped out from a random violent killing-spree act to stand for:

- an ear-splitting announcement that IS is growing strong and that it is recruiting wanna-be radicals via such “inspiring” acts.
- injection of hatred and distrust toward Muslim community, pushing them away from public and closer to them. IS is attempting to set a clear line of Black and White with Red blood.

## A destructive approach

In an effort to counter IS expansion, among various solutions, one suggests to shut down all refugee immigration. Clearly, those who advocate this policy have their heart and mind shadowed in fear.  Because it will only exacerbate the situation. Just imagine a Syrian father of two who wants to get away from IS and their wars must stay stuck. Eventually, if he does not fight for the radical belief, he will fight for bread and butter to feed himself and his family. That easily, we fall into the trap, we help them ticking box (1) and (2).

## Where is a sensible solution?

So the Western should let refugees immigrate? It is easier said than done. To fight against terrorism and protect values they have stood for, they must. However, the story goes beyond just letting people through the border lines. Western Governments need to set aside a great deal of budget and effort to establish a base for the immigrants since shelter, food, medical, education and employment etc. do not come from air. Low living conditions only worsen social security and welfare that immigrants are seeking. Furthermore, who knows how many IS members lurking in the lines of refugees to infiltrate and undermine the national security? The lessons have been painfully learnt as Paris, Istanbul and Brussels suicidal attacks were conducted by immigrants holding the Western passports.

Understanding the hardship they confront, I am still deeply saddened while observing much resistance within a so-called alliance. It seems like the responsibility ball is passed around endlessly. EU recently paid Turkey €3 billions to hold refugees in their country and stop them from entering Europe. After simultaneous terrorist attacks in the heart of Istanbul, Turkey came down to an agreement that they will accept one deported immigrant from Europe when EU accepts one legal immigrants. Bargains after bargains, negotiations after negotiations and immigrants’ future is still damped in refugee’s camp, waiting to be decided.

## From a biased heart

Like a chess game, IS’ moves are planned, set and rolled into action. On the other side of table, we read them all but hesitate to resist. We argue, conflict over minimal short-term benefits among ourselves. We even let other suffer for the sake of our goods.

Keep in mind, this is a war of believes. We are fighting for the liberal values of freedom, femininity, humanity,religions etc. that we believe. In struggles to protect those, the extreme solutions such as shutting down refugee immigration might just as well eradicate what we have stood for. Yes,  as viciously as our enemy is capable of.

This war will not be without guns, bullets and blood but it will never end with those. If our belief is righteous, let it be the winner. Let it pave our solutions to the end of this madness with kindness and warm hearts.

My heart stands with Brussels and her people.

For the smiles that never fade, the hopes that never die and the peace that will surviv
