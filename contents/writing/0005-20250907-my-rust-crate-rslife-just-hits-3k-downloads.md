This field is niche. I really mean it. When you say actuary, it is a almost guarantee the other side will start "What are you, actually?". Then the story goes the same every time the word echos out. Very few people knows us. I also feel that we are stuck in our little world of exams and proprietary software. This might be a bad-mouth to my profession but somehow, I sincerely feel it.

I have been using actuarial package since my bachelor. However, I worked in life sector and proprietary softwares are dominant.
